# challenge_portfolio

## Description
This challenge was a *Job-seeking coding assessments* or *take-home assignments*. These type of challenges do not provide a starter code, instead a code is built from scratch. This challenge was to create a web application that is a portfolio page. The user is a potential employer who can see my digital portfolio, which I will update with projects throughout this course as a hiring canidate. Challenge 2 delve into the creative side of programming. It was nice to see a visually pleasing finished product and I am excited to continue working on future web applications. Front end development is where art meets tech.
