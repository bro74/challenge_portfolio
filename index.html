                    <p>I am an academic crossing over to the dark side-programming. I also am a runner and mentor students through a local youth development sport mentorship program. You will most likely find me in the gym, running the streets of Philly or reading.</p>

                <h3>Work</h3>
                    <p>I have a background in psychology and neuroscience, with a focus in psychoneuroimmunology and disease through a resilience framework. However, that track is long. I hope to find a career that allows me to work remote while I run, yes literally run, or jog depending on the day, the world and can provide income while I attend graduate school for my PhD. I am a strong believer of movement, optimism and action. I have my work cut out for me, but consitency is key-just keep coding.</p>

<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport  -->
